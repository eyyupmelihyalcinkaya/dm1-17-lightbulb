DM1-17 Light Bulb Problem


The DM1-17 Light Bulb Problem project explores efficient algorithms for identifying correlated pairs within large datasets, 
particularly binary vectors. These algorithms address foundational challenges in computational theory and have applications in fields such as cryptography, 
bioinformatics, and machine learning.

Features
Algorithm Q: A quadratic approach that finds the most correlated pair through direct sampling.
Algorithm B: A subquadratic algorithm leveraging bucket-based grouping for efficiency.
Generalized k-Way Correlation Algorithm: Analyzes higher-order correlations for groups of variables.
Polynomial Analysis: Utilizes recursive bucketing and random projections for scalable analysis.
May-Ozerov Algorithm: Adapts locality-sensitive hashing for efficient correlation detection.
